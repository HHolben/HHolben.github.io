<h1>Blowing Bubbles and Breathing</h1>


<h2> Why This Skill Is Important</h2>
<p>

The first step in learning to swim is learning how to control one's breath. Air intake is important for an obvious reason: people drown in water, let's not drown when we are in the water.

</p>


<p>

Bubble blowing is a breathing exercise. I don't believe learning the skill is so much about learning that you can exhale underwater as it is about learning that you can prevent water from coming up your nose. When teaching I try to emphasize this point with my students: we all experience that horrible sensation of water getting up our nose. Bubble blowing is a skill is a skill we use to stop that from happening.

</p>

<p>


When swimming the freestyle, butterfly, or breast strokes, swimmers move their faces in and out of the water. This requires swimmers to use the time their faces are out of the water to quickly inhale, and the time their faces are in the water to slowly exhale. 

</p>

<p>

When performing proper freestyle, breast, or butterfly strokes, the swimmer has only a moment between one stroke and the next to inhale. As such a person who cannot blow air bubbles will struggle to perform any front-facing stroke properly. 

</p>

<p>

This is especially important if the swimmer intends to dive. When a swimmer points his or her head downward (as one does when diving straight down), the pressure of the water above will force water through the nostrils. If you yourself have done this before, (or if you've ever had something you were drinking go up your nose) you will recall that horrible sensation. This is easily prevented by blowing air bubbles, forcing the water to stay out. 

</p>

<p>

Learning how to blow bubbles is also an important step in building the swimmer's confidence. When you know how to control the air you carry down with you, you will grow in the confidence that you can swim safely.

All of this just goes to show the importance of blowing bubbles to the majority of swimming. When learning to swim, the skill of bubble blowing, as rudimentary as it is, must take priority over all other skills. 

</p>

<h2> Bubbles or Bust! </h2>

<p>

We have come to the ranting portion of this page. As a lifeguard, I have seen families come to the neighborhood pool with young swimmers who did not seem to know how to blow bubbles in the water. Many of these swimmers would jump into a pool with one hand locked firmly around their noses. 

</P>

<p>

This is disturbing because swimming one-handed means the swimmer only has half the power of his or her arms to keep afloat, change direction, and propel forward. Doing the work of two arms with one is exhausting. 

</p>

<p>
Thus a swimmer who attempts to swim by sacrificing an arm to plug the nose will swim inefficiently. What if that one armed swimmer were to have a cramp in the free arm? The swimmer would either have to use the arm that plugged the nose to swim to safety- or float and kick, relaxing both arms. The first solution would probably require the swimmer to blow bubbles anyway and the second solution uses floating which, as I've already explained, requires proper control of breathing. 

</p>

<p>

As a lifeguard, this is frightening. An exhausted swimmer is a swimmer who could begin to panic and drown. Panicking swimmers have to be rescued. Thus we do a disservice to many young swimmers when we fail to teach them to "blow out the underwater birthday candles".

</p>

<p>
Here is where I will rant about goggles with nose pieces. These goggles have their place. When swimming in unchlorinated water, nose blocks and nose plugs are useful for preventing you from accidentally inhaling water that could contain some really bad stuff. If you want to know why this is important, do a quick web search for "brain eating amoebas". According to the Red Cross, goggles with nose pieces might also be more suitable for swimmers who want to explore the deep bottoms of swimming pools as the water pressure is directed around the swimmers face instead of directly into the eye sockets. 

</p>

<p>

Despite this, I still prefer that students I teach wear goggles with no nose piece as I believe in the importance of developing the skill of blowing bubbles out the nose. In my view, overuse can make swimmers dependent on devices like goggles with nosepieces.
