<h1> IoT Gardening Project Idea </h1>
	
	<p>
	I want to build an outdoor automated vegetable gardening system. If successful, the system will measure garden qualities such as sunlight and soil moisture and perform gardening functions such as watering the soil. The system will use an online database for recording its measurements as well as for making decisions, i.e whether to water the soil and with how much water. Bellow is a tentative plan: 
	</p>
	
<h2> Steps involved: </h2>

<h2>Step 1: Choose a vegetable to grow. Factors to be considered include: </h2> 

<ul>
<li>plants that are known to grow in this region </li>
<li>Timeframe for gemination and harvest </li>
<li>Amount of care required for growth </li>
<li>Temperature and humidity needs </li>
</ul>

<h2>
Step 2: Research the chosen plant. Learn how and where to plant the vegetable for optimal growth. Sources to consider: 
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Gardening books </li>
<li>Farmer's almanac </li>
<li>Seed packs and catalogs </li>
<li>Home automation books </li>
<li>Home solar power books </li>
<li>Materials on hydraulic and water sprinkler systems </li>
</ul>
  
<h2>
Step 3: Prepare gardens: 2 gardens will be constructed: One to house an automated growing environment, and a second for a traditional "control test" garden. Each garden will consist of: 
 </h2>
 
 <ul>
 <li>A wooden garden bed frame </li>
<li>Gardening soil and ashes </li>
 <li>A mesh fence to guard plants from large pests </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 4: Choose factors to be monitored by the automated system. Possible factors include: </h2>

<ul>

<li>  Water </li>
<li>  Light </li>
<li>  Humidity </li>
 <li> Soil chemistry </li>
 <li> Animal and pest control </li>
<li> Factors related to the system itself: </li>
		 <li> Power consumption and generation </li>
		 <li> Temperature of electronics </li>
		<li>  Water available in reservoir (if a reservoir is used) </li>

</ul>

<h2>
Step 5: Plant seeds for germination. The vegetables to be grown in the gardens will likely need to be germinated early for optimal growth. 
</h2>
 
<h2>
Step 6: Design an algorithm to optimize fruit growth based on the factors that will be monitored by sensor. Inputs could include: 
Ratio of water to soil 
</h2>


<h2>
Step 7: Test or create sensors to monitor all chosen factors. 
</h2>


<h2>
Step 8: Write program for the system's controller that will: 
</h2>

<ul>


 <li> Monitor plants  </li>
<li>  Identify deficiency of any factor being monitored  </li>
 <li> Routinely report plant measurements  </li>
<li>  Alert user to plant deficiencies  </li>
<li>  Regulate at least one factor  </li>
<li>Transmit data to the user </li>

</ul>

<h2> Step 9: Build automated gardening system. Items will include: 
 A solar power system to generate the system's electricity. This will include: 
 </h2>
 <ul>
		 <li>Solar panels </li>
		 <li> A solar charge controller </li>
		<li>  A battery to supply power whenever the solar panel is not functioning (night, cloudy days, etc.) </li>
		<li>  Any electronics needed to adapt the available voltage for the system's controller </li>


     <li> The system's main controller. This controller must be able to: </li>
		
        <ul>
        
        <li> Read in inputs from sensors </li>
		<li> Analyze data for plant deficiencies </li>
		<li> Output signals to items such as: </li>
        </ul>

			<li> a sprinkler to water plants </li>
			<li>An electric speaker to repel insects or animals with high-frequency tones</li>
            
             
		
 <li> Sprinklers, and any hoses, valves, or water reservoirs needed to water plants </li>
 <li> A valve connected to either a water faucet, or a water reservoir with a sensor to detect when the reservoir must be manually refilled. </li>
   
<h2> Step 10: Transplant germinated seedlings into the test garden and the control garden. </h2>
<h2> Step 11: Grow plants, tend to the control garden, and allow test garden to run its course. </h2>
<h2> Step 12: Harvest fruits from gardens: these will need to be harvested on a case-by-case basis </h2>
<h2> Step 13: Compare fruit output between the two gardens. Weigh and measure all fruits produced. </h2>
<h2> Step 14: Sell all fruits. Compare the value of the sold fruit to the expense of implementing and maintaining the gardens.  </h2>
 Evaluate cash flow: compare costs and expenses to money earned  </h2>
<h2> Step 15: Write report </h2>
<h2> Step 16: Present findings at a conference </h2>
<h2> Step 17: Submit for publication </h2>
