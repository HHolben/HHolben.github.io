    I wrote and directed a long-take scene for an assignment for professor Kenny Suit's Digital Video Production and Editing class. After reviewing the footage and learning more about editing, I decided to put the footage from the different takes together. 
    
    If you would like to read the script or see the storyboard both are in this document:

    I gave Pablo Rivas (Carlisle) two coloring sheets to work on in the background of the scene. Pablo surprised me with his coloring choices but I really liked the results. Pablo gave me his blessing to show his work at the end of the video. Unfortunately I lost Pablo's original of "The Barque of Dante" so I colored my own version based on Pablo's version.
