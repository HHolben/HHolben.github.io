	<h1>Building a Trebuchet</h1>
</section>


<p>

	After I fell in love with electronic circuitry at age 12, I spent many hours gawking- nearly drooling over the books in Barnes and Nobel's science books section. I was especially drawn towards the books written for makers and DIY enthusiasts. 

	As a treat for me, my mother would take me there sometimes after school on fridays. On one such trip, she purchased Simon Monk's book, <a href="http://simonmonk.org/15-dangerously-mad-projects-for-the-evil-genius/">15 Dangerously Mad Projects For the Evil Genius</a> for me.

</p>

<p> The book's humorous tone made the book enjoyable for me but for a long time I didn't do a single project in the book. I just read through the details of how the projects that interested me were done. One of those dangerously mad projects was a trebuchet.

	I had heard about trebuchet's from a close friend of mine who built a model trebuchet for a science fair project. I wound up making a small catapult out of sticks, duct tape, and sticks I picked off the lawn. I threw a few pieces of gravel with that catapult, but it fell apart quickly. 

	I later planned to build a larger trebuchet- again just using fallen branches from my parents' yard

	It was not until years later, when I was in college, that i finally got around to tackling the trebuchet project.

I got recertified in lifeguarding at the Kingsport aquatic center, and took a three or four week course that earned me a "Water Safety Instructor" certification. The week after the class ended, I felt inspired to be productive on my Saturday mornings- it had felt so good to get out and do something interesting before the day even really began. On the next Saturday morning, I got up early and went back to the pile of scrap wood that had once been my family's old tool shed. 

On weekends I began making a raised garden bed for my mother using the pile of scrap wood that remained of the old shed. After I finished that garden bed, I needed to find a new project to fill my saturday mornings with and I was reminded of the trebuchet project from 15 Dangerously Mad Projects For the Evil Genius..

I started salvaging wood out of the pile to build myself a trebuchet.
