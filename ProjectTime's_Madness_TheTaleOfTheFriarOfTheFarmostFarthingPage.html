        I came up with the idea for this poem while lifeguarding at Martindale pool in Johnson City, and worked on a draft of it during some of my break time. I intend to use this poem in a series of childrens books I want to write. The poem will appear in one of the books as a collaborative effort of a group of boys aged 8 - 12 or so.
        The poem is inspired in part on the kinds of stories my friends and I would make up and tell eachother in grade school. It is written so that it can be read as a poem or sung to the tune of Yankee Doodle.
