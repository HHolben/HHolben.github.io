<h1>Breaststroke</h1>

<p> 
    I usually introduce students to the breastroke kick first, and later teach them the arm movement. I will start by having the student stand in front of me on the pool deck. I will stand on one foot and demonstrate the kick with the free leg and introduce each part of the kick. I will tell the student to try to mirror my motion. Note that younger swimmers may have some difficulty ballancing on one foot, and you will either need to hold their hand or move them to a wall or rail that they can hold on to. I use the phrase "Up, out, and around". The kick can be taught quickly by having the student hold onto the pool deck or a ladder and practicing the kick. I will hold the student's ankles and direct them at first, using the phrase "Up, out, and around" to emphasize the motion of the knees bending, the toes pointing and kicking out before bringting the heels back together. After the student can do a few cycles without any help, I will usually have them practice the kick with a kickboard.  
    
    In addition to teaching technique, it is also helpful to teach vocabulary as you go along. As I introduce new kicks I often ask the student to tell me the name of the kick or stroke. This is valuable for later on when you need to tell the swimmer to switch practicing from one stroke to another.

    Students can learn both a strong "racing" breastroke, as well as a modified breastroke used more for swimming around the bottom of a pool.

    There are lots of great instructional videos online for teaching the strokes the way they are performed in swim meets, here is one I found by Speedo: <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGZ8rIy-YtI> Speedo Swim Technique - Breaststroke - Created by Speedo, Presented by ProSwimwear</a>
    Here is a link to a short video from a 100 meter breastroke race at the 2012 Olympics: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsGHSe6N06w"></a>
