    <h1>Swimming Lessons</h1>
			<p>
                This is an index of resources and links to resources I to organize for the swim lessons I teach.       
            </br>
            </br>
            </br>
            This is a list of questions in progress for my swim lessons. If a swimmer can answer "yes" to all of these questions, then my instruction will probably not be the most helpful option to improve their swimming skills.
