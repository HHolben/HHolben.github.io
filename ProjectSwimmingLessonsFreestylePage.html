<h2>Swimming Freestyle: Useful Links:</h2>

<p>

Bellow are some links to useful resources for learning or teaching freestyle. I do not own any of this stuff, I merely found it on the internet.

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UzYFyaeGEY">This video </a> by Zoggs international contains a thorough, consise explanation of the freestyle stroke </li>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5yvhDCBj7I">This video </a> by isport.com shows some of the most common mistakes swimmers tend to make when 
performing this stroke. Note that most of these mistakes are "passable" for swimmers who are just learning the basics. It is not helpful to overwhelm a beginning swimmer, especially a young swimmer with all the details of the professional race stroke at once. Elements should be introduced and improved upon gradually as the swimmer becomes stronger, more confident, and more skillful.
